Stateful GoL
============

During a Code Retreat I tried to implement the Game of Life in Ruby with the following code restrictions: 
- No method could return anything
- No ifs

While very strange at first, this approach lead to an interesting design, that I intend to explore on a future blog
post

Since it's was a Code Retreat the point wasn't really on solving the problem, and I deleted the code after the end of the round. Once I got home, I couldn't resist to code the whole implementation and this are the results
